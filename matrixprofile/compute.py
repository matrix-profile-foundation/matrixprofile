def compute(ts, windows=None, query=None, sample_pct=1, threshold=0.98,
            n_jobs=1):
    """
    Computes the exact or approximate MatrixProfile based on the sample percent
    specified. Currently, MPX and SCRIMP++ is used for the exact and
    approximate algorithms respectively. When multiple windows are passed, the
    Pan-MatrixProfile is computed and returned.

    By default, only passing in a time series (ts), the Pan-MatrixProfile is
    computed based on the maximum upper window algorithm with a correlation
    threshold of 0.98.

    Notes
    -----
    When multiple windows are passed and the Pan-MatrixProfile is computed, the
    query is ignored!

    Parameters
    ----------
    ts : array_like
        The time series to analyze.
    windows : int, array_like
        The window(s) to compute the MatrixProfile. Note that it may be an int
        for a single matrix profile computation or an array of ints for
        computing the pan matrix profile.
    query : array_like, optional
        The query to analyze. Note that when computing the PMP the query is
        ignored!
    sample_pct : float, default 1
        A float between 0 and 1 representing how many samples to compute for
        the MP or PMP. When it is 1, the exact algorithm is used.
    threshold : float, default 0.98
        The correlation coefficient used as the threshold. It should be between
        0 and 1. This is used to compute the upper window size when no
        window(s) is given.
    n_jobs : int, default = 1
        Number of cpu cores to use.

    Returns
    -------
    dict : profile
        The profile computed.
